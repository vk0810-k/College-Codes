In addition to recognising seeing the need for specialist schools in varied disciplines at the headquarters in Mumbai, the parent body has also responded to the felt need for centres of excellence across the country, thereby widening the base of quality higher education. <span style="color: rgb(1, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is with this objective that we set up campuses at Shirpur, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Navi Mumbai and Dhule.</span>&nbsp;SVKM’s NMIMS has established its Navi Mumbai campus to develop students into global organizational leaders who can create wealth for their organizations. The new campus at Navi Mumbai offers MBA. The admission process for the MBA is through the "NMAT” by GMAC examination followed by Group Discussion and Personal Interview.</p>

SVKM's NMIMS Navi Mumbai Campus provides an idyllic environment to engage in learning and the unique distinction of gaining ringside insight to metropolitan corporate dynamics against a budding and emerging business hub.</p>
